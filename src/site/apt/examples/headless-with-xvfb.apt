Headless X11 with Xvfb

 To allow builds on headless Unix systems to function correctly with Selenium, you may
 need to configure Xvfb (virtual framebuffer X server for X Version 11).
 
 Use the <<<xvfb>>> goal to start up an Xvfb process.  This will try to detect an
 unused X11 display starting from <<<:20>>> and configure the Selenium server with that
 <<<DISPLAY>>> environment variable so that when launching browsers they startup using
 the virutal X11 server.

 <<NOTE:>>
 For execution of Xvfb to work correctly as a non-root user, the Xvfb process needs to be SUID-root.

chmod u+s `which Xvfb`

 You can also configure an explicit display to be used instead of autodetecting:

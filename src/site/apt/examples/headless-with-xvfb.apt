Headless X11 with Xvfb

 To allow builds on headless Unix systems to function correctly with Selenium, you may
 need to configure Xvfb (virtual framebuffer X server for X Version 11).
 
 Use the <<<xvfb>>> goal to start up an Xvfb process.  This will try to detect an
 unused X11 display starting from <<<:20>>> and configure the Selenium server with that
 <<<DISPLAY>>> environment variable so that when launching browsers they startup using
 the virutal X11 server.

 <<NOTE:>>
 For execution of Xvfb to work correctly as a non-root user, the Xvfb process needs to be SUID-root.

+----------+
chmod u+s `which Xvfb`

 You can also configure an explicit display to be used instead of autodetecting:

                <configuration>
                    <background>true</background>

            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>
</plugins>

 You may get an error like this in <<<target/selenium/xvfb.log>>> when you try to start Xvfb

+----------+
 Fatal server error:
 PAM authentication failed, cannot start X server.
        Perhaps you do not have console ownership?
+----------+

 From {{{https://lists.sdsc.edu/pipermail/npaci-rocks-discussion/2004-December/008837.html}the sdsc.edu mailing list}}

 To allow users to start an xserver you need to modify /etc/pam.d/xserver and make it look something like this:

+----------+
#%PAM-1.0
auth       sufficient   /lib/security/pam_rootok.so
#auth      required     /lib/security/pam_console.so
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_permit.so
account    required     /lib/security/pam_permit.so
+----------+

 This will permit authorization for users not at the console to start an X-server. Note: you may not have full pathnames in your file and that is okay.
